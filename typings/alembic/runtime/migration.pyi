    """Represent the database state made available to a migration
    script.

    :class:`.MigrationContext` is the front end to an actual
    database connection, or alternatively a string output
    stream given a particular database dialect,
    from an Alembic perspective.

    When inside the ``env.py`` script, the :class:`.MigrationContext`
    is available via the
    :meth:`.EnvironmentContext.get_context` method,
    which is available at ``alembic.context``::

        # from within env.py script
        from alembic import context
        migration_context = context.get_context()

    For usage outside of an ``env.py`` script, such as for
    utility routines that want to check the current version
    in the database, the :meth:`.MigrationContext.configure`
    method to create new :class:`.MigrationContext` objects.
    For example, to get at the current revision in the
    database using :meth:`.MigrationContext.get_current_revision`::

        # in any application, outside of an env.py script
        from alembic.migration import MigrationContext
        from sqlalchemy import create_engine

        engine = create_engine("postgresql://mydatabase")
        conn = engine.connect()

        context = MigrationContext.configure(conn)
        current_rev = context.get_current_revision()

    The above context can also be used to produce
    Alembic migration operations with an :class:`.Operations`
    instance::

        # in any application, outside of the normal Alembic environment
        from alembic.operations import Operations
        op = Operations(context)
        op.alter_column("mytable", "somecolumn", nullable=True)

        """Enter an "autocommit" block, for databases that support AUTOCOMMIT
        isolation levels.

        This special directive is intended to support the occasional database
        DDL or system operation that specifically has to be run outside of
        any kind of transaction block.   The PostgreSQL database platform
        is the most common target for this style of operation, as many
        of its DDL operations must be run outside of transaction blocks, even
        though the database overall supports transactional DDL.

        The method is used as a context manager within a migration script, by
        calling on :meth:`.Operations.get_context` to retrieve the
        :class:`.MigrationContext`, then invoking
        :meth:`.MigrationContext.autocommit_block` using the ``with:``
        statement::

            def upgrade():
                with op.get_context().autocommit_block():
                    op.execute("ALTER TYPE mood ADD VALUE 'soso'")

        Above, a PostgreSQL "ALTER TYPE..ADD VALUE" directive is emitted,
        which must be run outside of a transaction block at the database level.
        The :meth:`.MigrationContext.autocommit_block` method makes use of the
        SQLAlchemy ``AUTOCOMMIT`` isolation level setting, which against the
        psycogp2 DBAPI corresponds to the ``connection.autocommit`` setting,
        to ensure that the database driver is not inside of a DBAPI level
        transaction block.

        .. warning::

            As is necessary, **the database transaction preceding the block is
            unconditionally committed**.  This means that the run of migrations
            preceding the operation will be committed, before the overall
            migration operation is complete.

            It is recommended that when an application includes migrations with
            "autocommit" blocks, that
            :paramref:`.EnvironmentContext.transaction_per_migration` be used
            so that the calling environment is tuned to expect short per-file
            migrations whether or not one of them has an autocommit block.

        This method is used within an ``env.py`` script to demarcate where

                        context.run_migrations()

        Above, :meth:`.MigrationContext.begin_transaction` is used to demarcate
        where the outer logical transaction occurs around the
        :meth:`.MigrationContext.run_migrations` operation.

        A "Logical" transaction means that the operation may or may not
        correspond to a real database transaction.   If the target database
        supports transactional DDL (or
        :paramref:`.EnvironmentContext.configure.transactional_ddl` is true),
        the :paramref:`.EnvironmentContext.configure.transaction_per_migration`
        flag is not set, and the migration is against a real database
        connection (as opposed to using "offline" ``--sql`` mode), a real
        transaction will be started.   If ``--sql`` mode is in effect, the
        operation would instead correspond to a string such as "BEGIN" being
        emitted to the string output.

        The returned object is a Python context manager that should only be
        used in the context of a ``with:`` statement as indicated above.
