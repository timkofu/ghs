class PropComparator(operators.ColumnOperators):
    r"""Defines SQL operators for :class:`.MapperProperty` objects.

    SQLAlchemy allows for operators to
    be redefined at both the Core and ORM level.  :class:`.PropComparator`
    is the base class of operator redefinition for ORM-level operations,
    including those of :class:`.ColumnProperty`,
    :class:`.RelationshipProperty`, and :class:`.CompositeProperty`.

    .. note:: With the advent of Hybrid properties introduced in SQLAlchemy
       0.7, as well as Core-level operator redefinition in
       SQLAlchemy 0.8, the use case for user-defined :class:`.PropComparator`
       instances is extremely rare.  See :ref:`hybrids_toplevel` as well
       as :ref:`types_operators`.

    User-defined subclasses of :class:`.PropComparator` may be created. The
    built-in Python comparison and math operator methods, such as
    :meth:`.operators.ColumnOperators.__eq__`,
    :meth:`.operators.ColumnOperators.__lt__`, and
    :meth:`.operators.ColumnOperators.__add__`, can be overridden to provide
    new operator behavior. The custom :class:`.PropComparator` is passed to
    the :class:`.MapperProperty` instance via the ``comparator_factory``
    argument. In each case,
    the appropriate subclass of :class:`.PropComparator` should be used::
