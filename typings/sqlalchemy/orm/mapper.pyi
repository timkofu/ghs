        :ref:`Declarative <orm_declarative_mapping>` or
        :ref:`Imperative <orm_imperative_mapping>` mapping styles.

        .. versionchanged:: 1.4 The :func:`_orm.mapper` function should not
           be called directly for classical mapping; for a classical mapping
           configuration, use the :meth:`_orm.registry.map_imperatively`
           method.   The :func:`_orm.mapper` function may become private in a
           future release.

        Parameters documented below may be passed to either the
        :meth:`_orm.registry.map_imperatively` method, or may be passed in the
        ``__mapper_args__`` declarative class attribute described at
        :ref:`orm_declarative_mapper_options`.

        :param class\_: The class to be mapped.  When using Declarative,
          this argument is automatically passed as the declared class
          itself.

        :param local_table: The :class:`_schema.Table` or other selectable
           to which the class is mapped.  May be ``None`` if
           this mapper inherits from another mapper using single-table
           inheritance.   When using Declarative, this argument is
           automatically passed by the extension, based on what
           is configured via the ``__table__`` argument or via the
           :class:`_schema.Table`
           produced as a result of the ``__tablename__``
           and :class:`_schema.Column` arguments present.

        :param always_refresh: If True, all query operations for this mapped
           class will overwrite all data within object instances that already
           exist within the session, erasing any in-memory changes with
           whatever information was loaded from the database. Usage of this
           flag is highly discouraged; as an alternative, see the method
           :meth:`_query.Query.populate_existing`.

        :param allow_partial_pks: Defaults to True.  Indicates that a
           composite primary key with some NULL values should be considered as
           possibly existing within the database. This affects whether a
           mapper will assign an incoming row to an existing identity, as well
           as if :meth:`.Session.merge` will check the database first for a
           particular primary key value. A "partial primary key" can occur if
           one has mapped to an OUTER JOIN, for example.

        :param batch: Defaults to ``True``, indicating that save operations
           of multiple entities can be batched together for efficiency.
           Setting to False indicates
           that an instance will be fully saved before saving the next
           instance.  This is used in the extremely rare case that a
           :class:`.MapperEvents` listener requires being called
           in between individual row persistence operations.

        :param column_prefix: A string which will be prepended
           to the mapped attribute name when :class:`_schema.Column`
           objects are automatically assigned as attributes to the
           mapped class.  Does not affect explicitly specified
           column-based properties.

           See the section :ref:`column_prefix` for an example.

        :param concrete: If True, indicates this mapper should use concrete
           table inheritance with its parent mapper.

           See the section :ref:`concrete_inheritance` for an example.

        :param confirm_deleted_rows: defaults to True; when a DELETE occurs
          of one more rows based on specific primary keys, a warning is
          emitted when the number of rows matched does not equal the number
          of rows expected.  This parameter may be set to False to handle the
          case where database ON DELETE CASCADE rules may be deleting some of
          those rows automatically.  The warning may be changed to an
          exception in a future release.

          .. versionadded:: 0.9.4 - added
             :paramref:`.mapper.confirm_deleted_rows` as well as conditional
             matched row checking on delete.

        :param eager_defaults: if True, the ORM will immediately fetch the
          value of server-generated default values after an INSERT or UPDATE,
          rather than leaving them as expired to be fetched on next access.
          This can be used for event schemes where the server-generated values
          are needed immediately before the flush completes.   By default,
          this scheme will emit an individual ``SELECT`` statement per row
          inserted or updated, which note can add significant performance
          overhead.  However, if the
          target database supports :term:`RETURNING`, the default values will
          be returned inline with the INSERT or UPDATE statement, which can
          greatly enhance performance for an application that needs frequent
          access to just-generated server defaults.

          .. seealso::

                :ref:`orm_server_defaults`

          .. versionchanged:: 0.9.0 The ``eager_defaults`` option can now
             make use of :term:`RETURNING` for backends which support it.

        :param exclude_properties: A list or set of string column names to
          be excluded from mapping.

          See :ref:`include_exclude_cols` for an example.

        :param include_properties: An inclusive list or set of string column
          names to map.

          See :ref:`include_exclude_cols` for an example.

        :param inherits: A mapped class or the corresponding
          :class:`_orm.Mapper`
          of one indicating a superclass to which this :class:`_orm.Mapper`
          should *inherit* from.   The mapped class here must be a subclass
          of the other mapper's class.   When using Declarative, this argument
          is passed automatically as a result of the natural class
          hierarchy of the declared classes.

          .. seealso::

            :ref:`inheritance_toplevel`

        :param inherit_condition: For joined table inheritance, a SQL
           expression which will
           define how the two tables are joined; defaults to a natural join
           between the two tables.

        :param inherit_foreign_keys: When ``inherit_condition`` is used and
           the columns present are missing a :class:`_schema.ForeignKey`
           configuration, this parameter can be used to specify which columns
           are "foreign".  In most cases can be left as ``None``.

        :param legacy_is_orphan: Boolean, defaults to ``False``.
          When ``True``, specifies that "legacy" orphan consideration
          is to be applied to objects mapped by this mapper, which means
          that a pending (that is, not persistent) object is auto-expunged
          from an owning :class:`.Session` only when it is de-associated
          from *all* parents that specify a ``delete-orphan`` cascade towards
          this mapper.  The new default behavior is that the object is
          auto-expunged when it is de-associated with *any* of its parents
          that specify ``delete-orphan`` cascade.  This behavior is more
          consistent with that of a persistent object, and allows behavior to
          be consistent in more scenarios independently of whether or not an
          orphan object has been flushed yet or not.

          See the change note and example at :ref:`legacy_is_orphan_addition`
          for more detail on this change.

        :param non_primary: Specify that this :class:`_orm.Mapper`
          is in addition
          to the "primary" mapper, that is, the one used for persistence.
          The :class:`_orm.Mapper` created here may be used for ad-hoc
          mapping of the class to an alternate selectable, for loading
          only.

         .. seealso::

            :ref:`relationship_aliased_class` - the new pattern that removes
            the need for the :paramref:`_orm.Mapper.non_primary` flag.

        :param passive_deletes: Indicates DELETE behavior of foreign key
           columns when a joined-table inheritance entity is being deleted.
           Defaults to ``False`` for a base mapper; for an inheriting mapper,
           defaults to ``False`` unless the value is set to ``True``
           on the superclass mapper.

           When ``True``, it is assumed that ON DELETE CASCADE is configured
           on the foreign key relationships that link this mapper's table
           to its superclass table, so that when the unit of work attempts
           to delete the entity, it need only emit a DELETE statement for the
           superclass table, and not this table.

           When ``False``, a DELETE statement is emitted for this mapper's
           table individually.  If the primary key attributes local to this
           table are unloaded, then a SELECT must be emitted in order to
           validate these attributes; note that the primary key columns
           of a joined-table subclass are not part of the "primary key" of
           the object as a whole.

           Note that a value of ``True`` is **always** forced onto the
           subclass mappers; that is, it's not possible for a superclass
           to specify passive_deletes without this taking effect for
           all subclass mappers.

               CASCADE for joined-table inheritance mappers

        :param passive_updates: Indicates UPDATE behavior of foreign key
           columns when a primary key column changes on a joined-table
           inheritance mapping.   Defaults to ``True``.

           When True, it is assumed that ON UPDATE CASCADE is configured on
           the foreign key in the database, and that the database will handle
           propagation of an UPDATE from a source column to dependent columns
           on joined-table rows.

           When False, it is assumed that the database does not enforce
           referential integrity and will not be issuing its own CASCADE
           operation for an update.  The unit of work process will
           emit an UPDATE statement for the dependent columns during a
           primary key change.

               CASCADE for joined-table inheritance mappers

        :param polymorphic_load: Specifies "polymorphic loading" behavior
          for a subclass in an inheritance hierarchy (joined and single
          table inheritance only).   Valid values are:

            * "'inline'" - specifies this class should be part of the
              "with_polymorphic" mappers, e.g. its columns will be included
              in a SELECT query against the base.

            * "'selectin'" - specifies that when instances of this class
              are loaded, an additional SELECT will be emitted to retrieve
              the columns specific to this subclass.  The SELECT uses
              IN to fetch multiple subclasses at once.

         .. versionadded:: 1.2

         .. seealso::

            :ref:`with_polymorphic_mapper_config`

            :ref:`polymorphic_selectin`

        :param polymorphic_on: Specifies the column, attribute, or
          SQL expression used to determine the target class for an
          incoming row, when inheriting classes are present.

          This value is commonly a :class:`_schema.Column` object that's
          present in the mapped :class:`_schema.Table`::

            class Employee(Base):
                __tablename__ = 'employee'

                id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
                discriminator = Column(String(50))

                __mapper_args__ = {
                    "polymorphic_on":discriminator,
                    "polymorphic_identity":"employee"
                }

          It may also be specified
          as a SQL expression, as in this example where we
          use the :func:`.case` construct to provide a conditional
          approach::

            class Employee(Base):
                __tablename__ = 'employee'

                id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
                discriminator = Column(String(50))

                __mapper_args__ = {
                    "polymorphic_on":case([
                        (discriminator == "EN", "engineer"),
                        (discriminator == "MA", "manager"),
                    ], else_="employee"),
                    "polymorphic_identity":"employee"
                }

          It may also refer to any attribute
          configured with :func:`.column_property`, or to the
          string name of one::

                class Employee(Base):
                    __tablename__ = 'employee'

                    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
                    discriminator = Column(String(50))
                    employee_type = column_property(
                        case([
                            (discriminator == "EN", "engineer"),
                            (discriminator == "MA", "manager"),
                        ], else_="employee")
                    )

                    __mapper_args__ = {
                        "polymorphic_on":employee_type,
                        "polymorphic_identity":"employee"
                    }

          When setting ``polymorphic_on`` to reference an
          attribute or expression that's not present in the
          locally mapped :class:`_schema.Table`, yet the value
          of the discriminator should be persisted to the database,
          the value of the
          discriminator is not automatically set on new
          instances; this must be handled by the user,
          either through manual means or via event listeners.
          A typical approach to establishing such a listener
          looks like::

                from sqlalchemy import event
                from sqlalchemy.orm import object_mapper

                @event.listens_for(Employee, "init", propagate=True)
                def set_identity(instance, *arg, **kw):
                    mapper = object_mapper(instance)
                    instance.discriminator = mapper.polymorphic_identity

          Where above, we assign the value of ``polymorphic_identity``
          for the mapped class to the ``discriminator`` attribute,
          thus persisting the value to the ``discriminator`` column
          in the database.

          .. warning::

             Currently, **only one discriminator column may be set**, typically
             on the base-most class in the hierarchy. "Cascading" polymorphic
             columns are not yet supported.

          .. seealso::

            :ref:`inheritance_toplevel`

        :param polymorphic_identity: Specifies the value which
          identifies this particular class as returned by the
          column expression referred to by the ``polymorphic_on``
          setting.  As rows are received, the value corresponding
          to the ``polymorphic_on`` column expression is compared
          to this value, indicating which subclass should
          be used for the newly reconstructed object.

        :param properties: A dictionary mapping the string names of object
           attributes to :class:`.MapperProperty` instances, which define the
           persistence behavior of that attribute.  Note that
           :class:`_schema.Column`
           objects present in
           the mapped :class:`_schema.Table` are automatically placed into
           ``ColumnProperty`` instances upon mapping, unless overridden.
           When using Declarative, this argument is passed automatically,
           based on all those :class:`.MapperProperty` instances declared
           in the declared class body.

        :param primary_key: A list of :class:`_schema.Column`
           objects which define
           the primary key to be used against this mapper's selectable unit.
           This is normally simply the primary key of the ``local_table``, but
           can be overridden here.

        :param version_id_col: A :class:`_schema.Column`
           that will be used to keep a running version id of rows
           in the table.  This is used to detect concurrent updates or
           the presence of stale data in a flush.  The methodology is to
           detect if an UPDATE statement does not match the last known
           version id, a
           :class:`~sqlalchemy.orm.exc.StaleDataError` exception is
           thrown.
           By default, the column must be of :class:`.Integer` type,
           unless ``version_id_generator`` specifies an alternative version
           generator.

              :ref:`mapper_version_counter` - discussion of version counting
              and rationale.

        :param version_id_generator: Define how new version ids should
          be generated.  Defaults to ``None``, which indicates that
          a simple integer counting scheme be employed.  To provide a custom
          versioning scheme, provide a callable function of the form::

              def generate_version(version):
                  return next_version

          Alternatively, server-side versioning functions such as triggers,
          or programmatic versioning schemes outside of the version id
          generator may be used, by specifying the value ``False``.
          Please see :ref:`server_side_version_counter` for a discussion
          of important points when using this option.

          .. versionadded:: 0.9.0 ``version_id_generator`` supports

        :param with_polymorphic: A tuple in the form ``(<classes>,
            <selectable>)`` indicating the default style of "polymorphic"
            loading, that is, which tables are queried at once. <classes> is
            any single or list of mappers and/or classes indicating the

        This namespace includes attributes that are mapped to the class

           3 below.  In Python 3.6 and above this ordering will be the
           same as that of the class' construction, with the exception
           of attributes that were added after the fact by the application
           or the mapper.

        3. If a certain attribute key is also in the superclass ``__dict__``,
           then it's included in the iteration for that class, and not the
           class in which it first appeared.

def configure_mappers(): # -> None:
    """Initialize the inter-mapper relationships of all mappers that
    have been constructed thus far across all :class:`_orm.registry`
    collections.

    The configure step is used to reconcile and initialize the

    invoke configuration events such as the
    :meth:`_orm.MapperEvents.before_configured` and
    :meth:`_orm.MapperEvents.after_configured`, which may be used by ORM
    extensions or user-defined extension hooks.

    Mapper configuration is normally invoked automatically, the first time
    mappings from a particular :class:`_orm.registry` are used, as well as
    whenever mappings are used and additional not-yet-configured mappers have
    been constructed. The automatic configuration process however is local only
    to the :class:`_orm.registry` involving the target mapper and any related
    :class:`_orm.registry` objects which it may depend on; this is
    equivalent to invoking the :meth:`_orm.registry.configure` method
    on a particular :class:`_orm.registry`.

    By contrast, the :func:`_orm.configure_mappers` function will invoke the
    configuration process on all :class:`_orm.registry` objects that
    exist in memory, and may be useful for scenarios where many individual
    :class:`_orm.registry` objects that are nonetheless interrelated are
    in use.

    .. versionchanged:: 1.4

        As of SQLAlchemy 1.4.0b2, this function works on a
        per-:class:`_orm.registry` basis, locating all :class:`_orm.registry`
        objects present and invoking the :meth:`_orm.registry.configure` method
        on each. The :meth:`_orm.registry.configure` method may be preferred to
        limit the configuration of mappers to those local to a particular
        :class:`_orm.registry` and/or declarative base class.

    Points at which automatic configuration is invoked include when a mapped
    class is instantiated into an instance, as well as when ORM queries
    are emitted using :meth:`.Session.query` or :meth:`_orm.Session.execute`
    with an ORM-enabled statement.

    The mapper configure process, whether invoked by
    :func:`_orm.configure_mappers` or from :meth:`_orm.registry.configure`,
    provides several event hooks that can be used to augment the mapper
    configuration step. These hooks include:

    * :meth:`.MapperEvents.before_configured` - called once before
      :func:`.configure_mappers` or :meth:`_orm.registry.configure` does any
      work; this can be used to establish additional options, properties, or
      related mappings before the operation proceeds.

    * :meth:`.MapperEvents.mapper_configured` - called as each individual
      :class:`_orm.Mapper` is configured within the process; will include all
      mapper state except for backrefs set up by other mappers that are still
      to be configured.

    * :meth:`.MapperEvents.after_configured` - called once after
      :func:`.configure_mappers` or :meth:`_orm.registry.configure` is
      complete; at this stage, all :class:`_orm.Mapper` objects that fall
      within the scope of the configuration operation will be fully configured.
      Note that the calling application may still have other mappings that
      haven't been produced yet, such as if they are in modules as yet
      unimported, and may also have mappings that are still to be configured,
      if they are in other :class:`_orm.registry` collections not part of the
      current scope of configuration.
