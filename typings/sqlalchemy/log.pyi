"""Logging control and utilities.

Control of logging for SA can be performed from the regular python logging
module.  The regular dotted module namespace is used, starting at
'sqlalchemy'.  For class-level logging, the class name is appended.

The "echo" keyword parameter, available on SQLA :class:`_engine.Engine`
and :class:`_pool.Pool` objects, corresponds to a logger specific to that
instance only.
