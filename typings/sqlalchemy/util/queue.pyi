"""An adaptation of Py2.3/2.4's Queue module which supports reentrant
behavior, using RLock instead of Lock for its mutex object.  The
Queue object is used exclusively by the sqlalchemy.pool.QueuePool
class.

This is to support the connection pool's usage of weakref callbacks to return
connections to the underlying Queue, which can in extremely
rare cases be invoked within the ``get()`` method of the Queue itself,
producing a ``put()`` inside the ``get()`` and therefore a reentrant
condition.
