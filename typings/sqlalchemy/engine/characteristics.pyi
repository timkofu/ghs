    """An abstract base for an object that can set, get and reset a
    per-connection characteristic, typically one that gets reset when the
    connection is returned to the connection pool.

    transaction isolation is the canonical example, and the
    ``IsolationLevelCharacteristic`` implementation provides this for the
    ``DefaultDialect``.

    The ``ConnectionCharacteristic`` class should call upon the ``Dialect`` for
    the implementation of each method.   The object exists strictly to serve as
    a dialect visitor that can be placed into the
    ``DefaultDialect.connection_characteristics`` dictionary where it will take
    effect for calls to :meth:`_engine.Connection.execution_options` and
    related APIs.
